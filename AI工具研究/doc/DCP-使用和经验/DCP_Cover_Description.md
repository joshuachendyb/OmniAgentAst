# DCP Cover Art Description

A sophisticated visual representation of Dynamic Context Pruning (DCP) system design philosophy.

## Visual Elements

### Background
- **Gradient blue-to-light blue** (#F8FAFC to #E8F4F8): Represents clarity and intelligent optimization
- **Grid system**: Symbolizes the structured approach and systematic organization

### Left Side (Chaos - Before DCP)
- **Colored rectangles** in various colors (red, green, yellow, blue, orange): Represents tool outputs and conversation noise
- **Irregular placement**: Shows lack of structure and systemized organization
- **Color coding**: Different colored blocks represent different types of conversational clutter

### Right Side (Order - After DCP)
- **Aligned blue rectangles**: Represents pruned, organized conversation state
- **Consistent spacing**: Demonstrates systematic content management
- **Geometric precision**: Symbolizes the 30-50% token optimization achieved

### Central Elements
- **Large blue circle**: The DCP core system managing context
- **Three tool icons** (P, D, C): Represent Prune, Distill, Compress tools
- **Connection arrows**: Show the transformation from chaos to order

### Typography
- **Main title**: "Dynamic Context Pruning" - Bold, prominent positioning
- **Subtitle**: "系统秩序与动态优化" - Clear supporting text
- **Footer**: "OpenCode DCP 插件安装及使用说明" - Document identification
- **Tagline**: "智能上下文管理 • Token优化 • 系统化修剪" - Core benefits

### Color Palette
- **Primary Blue** (#1A365D): Professionalism, reliability
- **Accent Cyan** (#4CAF50): Dynamic optimization, efficiency  
- **Warning Orange** (#DC2626): Prune tool caution
- **Success Green** (#0EA5E9): Distill tool success
- **Info Blue** (#10B981): Compress tool information
- **Neutrals** (#E8F4F8, #F8FAFC): Structure and clarity

### Design Philosophy
This represents **Information System Order Philosophy** - in an age of conversation overload, DCP acts as a precise editor, removing redundancy while preserving essence, maintaining clear thinking pathways.

The visual flows from left (complex conversation chaos) to right (systemized order), with DCP as the central organizing force.
